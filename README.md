#  Scripts

This repository is a collection of one-off scripts I've created for various purposes, usually to help with office tasks, 

Instead of creating a new repository for each small script, Iâ€™ve decided to keep them all organized here in a single place called **"scripts"**.

##  Purpose
- Store miscellaneous scripts in one convenient repo.  
- Share helpful utilities or tools I write for work or to assist others.  
- Keep everything lightweight and easy to browse.
.

##  Notes
These scripts are not necessarily connected or production-level projects
